## NOTE: The tile coordinates are hard-coded from my experience with the game on my computer as of right now but could easily be changed to be customizable.

A very simple script that automates the classic Piano Tiles game mode at
**http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/**
Largely inspired by this awesome video **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAIUA-Oc1Y**

It could probably be adapted for other piano tile games but this is the one I happened to find

I have included some hopefully easy to follow instructions to get it running. As it stands the instructions assume you have python and the required libraries installed but I could add that part to these instructions if it was requested.

## Instructions
1. Click the green code button.
2. Click the Download zip button.
3. Save the zip file with the code to a directory where you will be able to find it. The desktop works for most people.

4. Open the zip file you downloaded to your desktop
5. Drag the folder inside to the desktop

6. Open the folder you dragged to your desktop
7. Hold shift and right click in some empty space in this folder
8. Click open Powershell window here (it might say open Command Prompt)

9. Type ` python main.py`
10. Press enter
11. Alt tab (switches windows to the window you were previously on) back to your open browser window with a classic game of http://tanksw.com/piano-tiles/ opened and ready to play (I did not originally say to open it but you can open it at this stage. The way markdown is set up it would be annoying to go back and renumber each step in these instructions)
**You have 2 seconds to do this or the program will automatically close so you do not lose control of your cursor. This is plenty of time to alt tab though.**
